Title: Yeast-Proteome Secondary-Structure Calculator
Description: An extension for 'NetSurfP-2.0' (Klausen et al. (2019) <doi:10.1002/prot.25674>)
    which is specifically designed to analyze the results of bottom-up-proteomics that is
    primarily analyzed with 'MaxQuant' (Cox, J., Mann, M. (2008) <doi:10.1038/nbt.1511>).
    This tool is designed to process a large number of yeast peptides that produced as a
    results of whole yeast cell-proteome digestion and provide a coherent picture of
    secondary structure of proteins.
